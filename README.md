How to create a fancy Github profile with README?
#github #webdev #beginners #tutorial
In this article, we will show you how to use GitHub in a way that you never thought could be used. You will learn how to use your GitHub profile as a resume (CV) or, even more, as a presentation site for yourself or your company. You will learn how to customize, in a very beautiful way, the first page that a user sees when he enters your GitHub profile. We will show you how you can display the repos you are most proud of, how to list your written articles, how to present your youtube channel, and much more.

First of all, you need to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. Go to this link to create an account.
To fully understand what is presented in this article, it is necessary to understand, at a basic level, the markdown and the HTML languages. Therefore, in your support, we attach two pdfs with the cheat sheet for markdown and HTML.

Now let's get started! üòÑ

Table of contents:

1. Getting started

2. My Resume example content

3. Extra content for Github profile

1. Getting started
In order to tell people information about you, you can add README.md to your GitHub profile. This is the secret way you can show your skills and projects to the GitHub community. It is very simple to do this; all you have to do is make a public repo, named with the username of your GitHub account and a README.md file in which to put all the content you want to appear on your profile. For example, if your username is my-username you need to do a public repo with the name my-username in which to put the README.md file. The contents of this file will appear on your profile before all your repos.

2. My Resume example content
Below we will show you how you can share your CV with people who visit your Github profile. We tried to structure the content so as to include as many elements as possible that can be included in a CV, regardless of the level of experience or field of activity.

We created a complex template with a resume example here.

Insert a banner in your Readme
This section is the first section of your profile. Here you can add an image as a banner, a gif, a dynamic svg or anything that you like.
Optionally, you can add a link to your website.

Image as a banner with a link
Example Preview:

Header

Code snippet:
[![Header](https://www.creative-tim.com/blog/content/images/size/w1140/2021/08/rebranding-post--1-.jpg "Header")](https://www.creative-tim.com/)

Insert header with a gif in your readme
Example Preview:

Hi there ‚úã!

Code snippet:
Hi there ‚úã!
About me section in GitHub profile
In this section, you can write a few words that best describe you. For this, you can use custom fonts and icons or emojis. The fonts can be found online, or you can generate your text in another tool and then just paste it here.

Example Preview:

Fully Coded UI Tools to create web and mobile apps. UI Kits, Templates, and Dashboards built on top of Bootstrap, Vue.js, React, Angular, Node.js, and Laravel. Join over 1,6M creatives to access all our products!

Besides fancy fonts, you can also add style to your resume by using emojis.
For mac users, you can easily access the emojis panel by pressing command + control + space.

Hobbies Section in Github profile
Like most people, you can also have some hobbies, and you should also mention them in order for the employer to know you better.
There are several ways to add them, but the most common one is using a list.

List
Unordered list:

For an unordered list, you will have to add your items preceded by - or *.

Example Preview:

Hobby 1
Nested Hobby 1
Sub-nested Hobby 1
Hobby 2
Hobby 3
Code Snippet:
* Hobby 1
  * Nested Hobby 1
    * Sub-nested Hobby 1
* Hobby 2
* Hobby 3
Ordered list:

For an ordered list, you will have to add numbers before your items.

Example Preview:

Hobby 1
Nested Hobby 1
Nested Hobby 2
Hobby 2
Hobby 3
Code Snippet:
1. Hobby 1
    1. Nested Hobby 1
    2. Nested Hobby 2
2. Hobby 2
3. Hobby 3
Emojis list:

For this kind of list, you will have to add an emoji before each item.

Example Preview:

1Ô∏è‚É£. Hobby 1

2Ô∏è‚É£. Hobby 2

3Ô∏è‚É£. Hobby 3

or

üèî. Hobby 1 (Hiking)

üìö. Hobby 2 (Reading)

üíª. Hobby 3 (Programming)

Code Snippet:
 1Ô∏è‚É£. Hobby 1 
 2Ô∏è‚É£. Hobby 2  
 3Ô∏è‚É£. Hobby 3  

or  

 üèî. Hobby 1 (Hiking)  
 üìö. Hobby 2 (Reading)  
 üíª. Hobby 3 (Programming) 

Note: For this list you will need to add 2 spaces at the end of each item. Those 2 spaces will put each item on a new line.

Images list:

In the same way you can add a gif image as a banner in the header, you can also add static images as list items.

Example Preview:

Hiking

Reading

Programming

or

<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2021/09/03/15/37/mountain-6596074_1280.jpg" width="100px"> Hiking

Insert My experience section in GitHub profile
Every resume must have this section for the employer to know if you are fit for the role.

In this section, you can be as creative as possible. For example, you can add your experience in programming using icons.

Programming languages:

Thanks for all the info! Super helpful for beginners on how to start sprucing up GH profiles.

I've also seen the use of <details> and <summary> HTML tags that help make the README a little more concise and require less scrolling.
